    "## 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models, particularly **LightGBM and XGBoost**, enhanced with **anomaly detection** techniques. The final model helps identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Dataset\n",
    "- **Source**: Credit card transactions dataset\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - `Time`: Timestamp of the transaction\n",
    "  - `V1-V28`: PCA-transformed features to anonymize sensitive data\n",
    "  - `Amount`: Transaction amount\n",
    "  - `Class`: Target variable (0 = Normal Transaction, 1 = Fraudulent Transaction)\n",
    "- **Size**: ~285,000 transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Key observations:\n",
    "- Fraudulent transactions account for only **0.17%** of the dataset (highly imbalanced data).\n",
    "- Distribution analysis shows that **fraudulent transactions are lower in value** compared to normal ones.\n",
    "- Feature correlation indicates that some PCA-transformed features (`V4`, `V11`, `V17`, etc.) are highly correlated with fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing\n",
    "1. **Handling Imbalance**: Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance fraud cases.\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized `Amount` feature to match the PCA-scaled features.\n",
    "3. **Anomaly Detection**: Used **Isolation Forest** to generate an `anomaly_score` as a new feature.\n",
    "4. **Train-Test Split**: Data was split into **80% training / 20% testing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Model Selection & Evaluation\n",
    "### **1️⃣ XGBoost Model**\n",
    "| Metric      | Score  |\n",

    "| Precision  | 0.79   |\n",
    "| Recall     | 0.86   |\n",
    "| F1-score   | 0.82   |\n",
    "| AUC-ROC    | 0.9868 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ LightGBM Model** (Final Model)\n",
    "| Metric      | Score  |\n",
    "|------------|--------|\n",
    "| Precision  | 0.62   |\n",
    "| Recall     | 0.87   |\n",
    "| F1-score   | 0.72   |\n",
    "| AUC-ROC    | 0.9717 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📈 Business Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Reducing False Positives: Helps prevent unnecessary transaction declines for legitimate users.\n",
    "🔹 Reducing False Negatives: Ensures that fraudulent activities are detected before financial losses occur.\n",
    "🔹 Scalability: The model can be deployed in real-time fraud detection systems used by financial institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Imbalanced-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Processing (SMOTE, Isolation Forest, PCA, StandardScaler)\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "🏆 **XGBoost was chosen as the final model due to its superior recall and AUC-ROC scores.**"
